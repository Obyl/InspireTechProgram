# Inspire Tech Timer and Leaderboard
In 2018, [Inspire Tech Canada](http://inspiretechcanada.ca/) held their first Tech Expo at Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario, Canada.
At the event, various robotics teams competed in a racing competition.
Essentially, the goal was to get as far around the course (gaining points as they went) as they could in the allotted time.
This program served as the countdown timer and associated leaderboard for that event.

## Developement
The project was developed by Oliver Byl in Java using the JDK's JavaFX tool.

## Downloading
You are more than welcome to download the source code.
If you're just interested in the already-built program, I've included an executable jar file in this main directory.
